               Despite of that, almost every year on 29th Sept, Rev. Elton celebrated the church anniversary 
               and the annual accomplishment of the construction. A severe shock of earthquake shook Sandakan 
               on 21st Sept 1897 but no damage to the stone walls of the church. The construction work 
               continued with significant progress each year and finally it was completed in 1906. In 30th 
               Sept. 1906, the church of St. Michael was dedicated. Rev. Elton continued as the Rector until 
               1914 where he went back to England and passed away on 17th Dec 1914.

               13 years appeared a long time to modern builders who could easily complete such a project in a 
               year. As for Rev. Elton, a full time minister, he had to attend to his visiting duties as well 
               as supervisor and administrative duties. All construction work was suspended whenever he was 
               away. Apart from that he also faced the shortage of money, the lack of skilled workers, the 
               absence of lifting equipment and machinery to carry the stones and the initial skepticism of 
               the church committee over an ambitious project. Nevertheless, he labored on with the vision and 
               conviction that God had given him until the completion of the building for the sake of the people 
               and the future generation of Sandakan.

                From then on, a number of priests came who most of them attached to St. Michael’s school as the 
                principal before become the rector of St. Michael’s church. In 1914, Rev. Thomas Cecil Alexander
                was appointed as rector and followed by Archdeacon Bernard Mercer who took the office as rector 
                from 1926 – 1939. Then Rev. Henthorne who was the headmaster of St. Michael’s school since 1936, 
                took over as the rector of St. Michael’s church and assisted by Rev. Sung Khi Fong.

                The Japanese landed in Sandakan in 1942. On 28th Sept. 1942 the church was closed and was used as 
                military store. Services were then held in Rev. Sung Khi Fong’s house. On 5th June 1945, the church 
                was bombed and burned. Rev. Sung was the priest in-charge until 1947 when Rev. Sparrow took over 
                from 1947 until 1949. From 1949 – 1950, Rev. Sung was in-charged again.

                In 1950, Rev. Frank Lomax arrived and looked into the rebuilding and restoration of the church. 
                The church was restored in 16th Dec 1950. Rev. Lomax was burdened to do the interior mission. 
                He was heavily involved in mission and evangelism work in the interior of Sabah such as Labuk, 
                Tongud, Sapi, Telupid and Segama area together with Bruce Sandilands who had the similar burden 
                and vision. The North Borneo Interior Mission (now Sabah Anglican Interior Mission, SAIM) was 
                started in 1956. In 30th Dec 1957, Epiphany Mission Tongud was started with Bishop Cornwall 
                commissioning Rev. Puntang and Catechist Kiri for the work.

                In 1973, The Ven. Yong Ping Chung was sent to be the rector of St. Michael’s church. It was 
                another turning point for the church. In 30 – 31st July 1973, an important meeting took place 
                whereby a thorough and critical consultation held for SAIM. It was the first time since 1965. 
                The whole SAIM was reviewed and constructive recommendations were made. Among the recommendations 
                made included the setting up of a simple bible school, translations of reading of Gospels and Epistles 
                into the local languages, more emphasis on evangelism and the catechist system to be reorganized.

                The Ven. Yong Ping Chung is a man of vision and dream. After praying for almost two years ,he 
                proposed the building of a daughter church in 1976 and the building fund was started in August 
                1978. The daughter church, The Church of The Good Shepherd was consecrated on 6th May 1984.

            <h5 id="6">Spiritual Revival (1985 – 1998)</h5>
            <p>
                In the 1990s, Rev. Ku Tuk Su, the Rector during that time and his pastoral team, led the church 
                into spiritual revival. The church experienced the power of the Holy Spirit as it moves in the 
                Spirit through praise and worship, weekly revival prayer meetings and other evangelistic meetings. 
                Many back-slided Christians came back to church as they recommit their lives. Many people were set 
                free from their spiritual bondages, healings took place, families turned to Christ and many altars 
                were demolished. Young men and women dedicated their lives to serve God full time. In 1991, the 
                construction of the Parish Hall began as the St. Monica primary school is relocated to mile 5. It 
                was completed and dedicated by Bishop Yong Ping Chung in 1993.
