                        A group of POW relatives from Australia initiated the installation of stained glass in the 
                        rch as a memorial to the POW and a way of appreciation to the local people who risked their 
                        lives to help the POW during the Japanese occupation.

                        In 2004, the stained glass windows known as the fellowship Windows were dedicated in a 
                        special service accompanied by the magnificent Hallelujah Chorus. The uplifting designs of 
                        four windows which tell different messages from the Bible, enhance the worship atmosphere in 
                        the church.
